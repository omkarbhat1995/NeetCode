Problem: Group Anagrams
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/group-anagrams/
Approach: Use a Hash Map where the key is a tuple representing the character count 
(26 zeroes for a-z) and the value is a list of strings that match that count.
Time Complexity: O(m * n) where m is number of strings, n is average length
Space Complexity: O(m * n)
